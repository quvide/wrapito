This is supposed to be a readme. Or something. This is mostly a project only for learning React but as a side effect it reads some data from Riot's public api. And displays it in a very incomplete form. I might improve it sometime in the future.

If you want to run this yourself, install flask, flask-sqlalchemy and redis first. `backend$ cp config_example.ini config.ini` and add your api key there. Then start the backend with `backend$ python3 backend.py`. You can run the dev web server with `frontend$ npm run start`.
